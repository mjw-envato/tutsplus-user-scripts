# tutsplus-user-scripts
Repo to host .user.js Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey scripts

## To install the Envato YouTube Tagger

1. Open Chrome, select **(Menu) > Extensions > Manage Extensions**, and turn on "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top right.
2. Install Tampermonkey: [follow this link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), then click **Add to Chrome**.
3. Follow this link: [https://mjw-envato.github.io/tutsplus-user-scripts/youtube_url_tagger.user.js] then click **Install**.
4. Open [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/), edit a video, and check that there is a button above the description labeled "Set URL Parameters".

Please contact Michael Williams on Slack if you run into any problems with any of this; Google tends to move things around and that can stop any of these steps working.

It may be possible to get this script working in another browser, but I've only confirmed it working in Chrome, so it's easiest to stick with that.

Once installed, simply click "Set URL Parameters" once you've finished your video's description, and it should automatically update all Envato URLs to use the correct UTM tags for tracking.
